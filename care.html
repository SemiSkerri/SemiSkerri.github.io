             First you must making the perfect plant soil!
        </h1>
           
          <p>  
            Depending on your type of plant, the type of soil they require will vary. Most typical houseplants 
            do fantastically in a chunky soil though, so always have some on hand! It is easy to make and doesn't 
            break the bank! You only need a few ingredients to whip up a medium that your plants will love!

            Depending on your plant and preference the amount of each substrate can be changed, however a good base is
            a 1:1 ratio of each mixed thoroughly.

           This video with Wild Fern does not use any soil in her chunky soil. Once you get into the hobby you will 
           find out what you perfer. Some people are over water-ers and require more perlite and bark to make sure the 
           plants do not rot, while others are under water-ers and require more soil or coco coir to ensure their plants
           do not overly dry. There are many different soil combinations and many depend on the type of plant you are 
           using it with and the type of plant parent you are. I would suggest making small batches of different types of soil 
           and see what works best for your life-style and types of plants!

            <p> There are many things to consider when it comes to lighting. Each plant needs sunlight to photosynthesize and create energy but individual plants 
            may have different needs. There are different types of light as well. Lets look at our infographic to show what light does when it shines in from a east-facing 
            window. As we can see we have direct sun, medium light, and indirect light. Some plants like the Monstera prefer indirect light to simulate the dappled light of 
            it's native rainforests. Other plants like cacti trive in bright, direct sunlight for up to 12 hours a day. Take a moment to understand your plant's needs before
            finding its place in your home. </p>
