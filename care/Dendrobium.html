<p> Dendrobium are in the orchid family and follow some different rules than regular house plants. Orchids usually do not like their roots to dry out nor do they like wet feet, so small, frequent waterings are helpful to keep them happy. The Dendrobium likes to have a dry period during the winter where water is greatly reduced. Dendrobium love hight light so give them as much as you can!
