        My name is Alex and I have been collecting orchids and other plants for more than ten years. I have learned to grow plants in different environments and temperatures and love to watch them grow 
            and flourish. Originally from Wyoming I had to have large terrariums to contain my high humidity orchids, but when I moved to South Carolina I was able to utilize the great weather and hight
            natural humidity to my advantage. My biggest resource to learning how to care for my plants was google and the wealth of information found there. I also follow YouTube creators that are both 
            knowledgable and funny when it comes to their information offered. If you want a more in-depth deepdive, any blog such as 
            <a href="https://greeneryunlimited.co/blogs/plant-care/monstera-deliciosa-care?srsltid=AfmBOorDUEJxv3HONC7O-nGViN_Lt3Fm15dHdsv8ddWQ1kb4W2AQOWUs" target="_blank"> GreeneryUnlimited</a> are great
            places to start.
